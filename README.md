## Predicting whether a Kickstarter project will get fully funded or not.  

## Project Overview 
Ever wonder why some Kickstarter campaigns get funded while others do not? Maybe an idea seems to good to fail yet remains unfunded. Kickstater is a lively and active community with projects that range from movies and music to clothing or an app. More than $3 billion dollars have already been contributed to fund these projects. In order for a project to get funded, they must fully reach their goal and not a penny short. 

We are going to look into what factors are most influential in getting a project funded. Future clients will know what is needed for the greatest chance of success. 

## Data
The data comes from a Kaggle competition. There are two data sets, train.csv and test.csv. The train data consists of sample projects from the May 2009 to May 2015. The test data consists of projects from June 2015 to March 2017.   

The data is fairly clean and organized, needing little clean up.
