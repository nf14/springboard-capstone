# Springboard Capstone 
## Predicting whether a Kickstarter project will get fully funded or not.  

## Project Description 
**Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?** 
Those who want to start a Kickstarter campaign. Knowing the most influential factor in getting funded, the client will know what is needed for the greatest chance of success.   
**What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?**
Kaggle data  

**In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem.**  
Begin cleaning up the data. Come up with potential theories. Analyze and explore the data. Discover what factor(s) will predict whether a campaign will get funded or not. 


## Data Wrangling 
I'm starting with a data set from Kaggle.  

The data is already fairly clean so I will not need to do too much clean up. 

### Packages Used
```{r}
library(dplyr)  
library(tidyr)  
library(anytime)  
library(readr)  
library(lubridate)  
```


### Import & View the data
[data set](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/funding-successful-projects/data) 
```{r}
ks <- read_csv("~/Downloads/train.csv.zip")
View(ks)
```

**Clean up the data** 
1. Only include US $ currency  
```{r}
ks_us <- subset(ks, currency == "USD")
```

2. Change date unix format 
```{r}
ks_us$deadline <- anytime(ks_us$deadline)
ks_us$created_at <- anytime(ks_us$created_at)
ks_us$launched_at <- anytime(ks_us$launched_at)
```

3. Extract dealine hour
```{r}
ks_us$deadline_hour <- hour(ks_us$deadline)
```

4. Extract year, month and day
```{r}
ks_us$deadline <- as.Date(strptime(ks_us$deadline, "%Y-%m-%d"))
ks_us$created_at <- as.Date(strptime(ks_us$created_at, "%Y-%m-%d"))
ks_us$launched_at <- as.Date(strptime(ks_us$launched_at, "%Y-%m-%d"))
```

**Create New Metrics**
Days between created and deadline
```{r}
ks_us$date_cd <- difftime(ks_us$deadline,ks_us$created_at, units = "days")
```

**Getting to know the data**
1. Explore funded data
```{r}
ks_funded <- ks_us[ks_us$final_status=="1",]
mean(ks_funded$goal)

ks_funded[ks_funded$goal>1000,]


```

Funded Info
-mean $9,881
...what else???


Explore unfunded
```{r}

ks_unfunded <- ks_us[ks_us$final_status=="0",]

mean(ks_unfunded$goal)

```
